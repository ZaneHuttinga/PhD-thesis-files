# PhD thesis supplementary files
This repository contains two files related to my doctoral thesis "The homology of the kernel space of the Thom spectrum in low degrees", written while at the University of Minnesota—Twin Cities. The individual files are explained below.

## Sage worksheet (.sagews)
This file contains SageMath code used to aid computations in Chapter 2 of the thesis. The process of computing products in the homology ring of SL_1 MU consists of a few steps, and this code performs the first of them. With the output of the code in hand, one must still simplify the result by canceling terms and applying relevant Ravenel–Wilson relations.

## Coefficient equations (.pdf)
This pdf contains a reformatted version of the tables that appear at the end of Appendix A (starting with Table A.6 on page 112). The tables contain explicit Ravenel–Wilson relations. These relations as originally found by Ravenel and Wilson in 1977 take the form of an equation in a very large infinite power series ring; the tables in the thesis present the coefficients on each monomial in the given infinite series. These equations become extremely long very quickly, so the equations in the thesis are split by many page breaks. The pdf here contains the same equations with no page breaks within single equations and minimal page breaks within a given monomial degree.
